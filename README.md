# ChatServiceBus
ChatServiceBus has been made as an example on how to use an Azure Service Bus.
This console application allows you to make a chat with multiple people at the same time.
The software also supports offline communication, because the two users doesnâ€™t need to be connected at the same time to receive the message.
